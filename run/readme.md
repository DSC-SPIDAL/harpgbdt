run
=========

We keep the scripts for all the experiments in this directory, such as:

+ installation, 1.InstallDAAL, 2.InstallXGBoost, 7.InstallLightGBM
+ dataset,  17.Datasets, 3.BasicBenchmark
+ run/profiling scripts, 16.Final-Sync, 18.PaperExperiments
+ HarpGBDT compiling, go to "sub/xgb-optapprox" and refer to "makeall.sh"

As the codebase evolves, some of them may not be updated.

In order to run the experiments quickly, you can follow the tutorial at "run/19.Tutorial".
